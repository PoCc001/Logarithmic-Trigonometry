# Logarithmic-Trigonometry
A tiny arithmetic library for calculating the natural logarithm of trigonometric functions in C/C++.

The advantage of using this library, instead of just writing log(sin(x)) is that it will output accurate results when the trigonometric function returns a value near 1. It may be worth extending the supported argument range to all the finite floating-point numbers.
